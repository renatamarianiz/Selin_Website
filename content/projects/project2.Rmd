In this article, we will study climate change for which we find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt).

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period for which NASA chose the period between 1951-1980.

# Data Set
The data set is loaded in the code chunk below, and stored as `weather`. For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, #the real data table starts in row 2, so we need to skip row 1
           na = "***") #inform R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded

```

Before moving on, the data frame will be converted from wide to long format and stored this as a new data frame called `tidyweather`. The result is a data frame with three variables: `year`, `month` and `delta`. Specifically, `delta` stores the temperature deviation values for the specified year and month.

```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% select(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec) %>% 
  gather("month","delta",2:12)
```

# Monthly and Yearly Temperature Deviations
Next, the data is plotted using a time-series scatter plot together with a trendline. For this, a new variable is created called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically.


```{r ts_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="#FF0000") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="",
       y="Temperature deviation",
    title="Alarming: one unit increase in temperature in less than a century",
    subtitle="Time series plot of temperature deviation compared to the base period 1951-1980")

```

Looking at these weather anomalies on a monthly scale, we see that the observed temperature deviations in the summer months are more closely to the observed trends for the specific months compared to the winter months. In other words, the temperature deviations in the winter months are much more volatile than in the summer months, indicating that climate change is affecting the winter periods more severely.

```{r ts_plot_month, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="#FF0000") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (x="",
        y="Temperature deviation",
        title = "Winter month temperatures show higher variance compared to summer months",
        subtitle="Weather anomalies per month") + 
  facet_wrap(~month)
```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. In this case, a new data frame will be created called `comparison`, which groups data from `tidyweather` in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. Data before 1800 is removed and a new variable called `interval` is created which contains information on which period each observation belongs to.


```{r intervals_time}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>% #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Using the new `interval` variable, a new density plot can be created to study the distribution of monthly temperature deviations, grouped by the different time periods of interest.

```{r density_plot, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval)) + #group and colour the data by different time periods
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +
  labs (x="Temperature deviation",
        y="",
        title="Temperatures have been rising consistently for the past century",
        subtitle="Density plot of monthly temperature anomalies per specified time intervals")

```

Moving on to average annual anomalies, the temperature deviations compared to the base period of 1951-1980 started increasing exponentially from mid-20th century onwards. Similar to what we saw before, this is a clear indication of the fact that climate change is accelerating.

```{r averaging_annual, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE))  #get mean delta per year

#plot yearly average deltas
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y=annual_average_delta)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color="#FF0000") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (x="",
        y="Average annual temperature deviation",
        title="Temperature deviations started growing exponentially from mid-20th century",
          subtitle="Development of average yearly temperature anomaly")                         


```


# Confidence Interval for Temperature Deviations

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that a one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Now, confidence intervals will be constructed for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Let's start with the `infer` package. The code snippet is taken from a [stackoverflow query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35953394/calculating-length-of-95-ci-using-dplyr). Based on this method, 95% of the 99 observed temperature deviations from 2011-present fall between ~0.908 and ~1.014

```{r, ci_infer}

formula_ci_infer <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% #choose the interval 2011-present
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  summarise(mean = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n()) %>%
  mutate(se = sd / sqrt(count),
         lower_ci = mean - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se,
         upper_ci = mean + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se)
  
formula_ci_infer # print confidence interval output
```

Next, let's construct a confidence interval again but this time using bootstrapping. In this case, 95% of the temperature deviations between 2011 and the present are between ~0.916 and ~1.015. This is very close to the confidence interval produced by the first method above, however it is slightly higher.

```{r, ci_bootstrap, warning=FALSE}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci_bootstr <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% #choose the interval 2011-present
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  specify(response=delta) %>% 
  generate(reps=100,type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="mean") %>% 
  
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile") # perform bootstrap

formula_ci_bootstr # print confidence interval output

```

# Conclusion
Climate change has been subject to some intense debates over the past years. Some scientists or politicians deny its existence, whereas others sketch the darkest doom scenarios for the coming century. An objective stand can be taken when looking at time series data measuring temperature levels. The analysis in this article shows that temperatures have been rising faster and faster throughout the past decades as compared to the time period 1951-1980. The increase is becoming exponential, which is reason to worry in case nations do not take an active role to combat this increase.
