In the visualisation below, the UKIP clearly stands out with a strong preference for leaving the EU. Specifically, constituencies where the UKIP made up a larger percentage of the votes in the UK 2015 elections had larger leave percentages in the 2016 Brexit Referendum.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will study climate change for which we find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here.
To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period for which NASA chose the period between 1951-1980.
Data Set The data set is loaded in the code chunk below, and stored as weather.</description>

      <description>Back in 2014, fivethiryeight.com published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The article discusses country-specific beer, wine, and spirit consumption per person in 2010. In the following article, these consumption figures will be analysed in order to find out where people drink the most beer, wine and spirits. The data set on which this analysis is based can be easily retrieved from the fivethirtyeight package and will be called drinks here.</description>
